# Intro

I am a results-driven full stack developer with a year of hands-on experience, complemented by a Masterâ€™s in Information Systems from Delhi Technological University, and a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Engineering from Thapar University. I also completed a diploma in Full Stack Web Development from Lighthouse Labs. My skills span various programming languages and frameworks, including JavaScript, ReactJS, and NodeJS. Fluent in English, Hindi, and Punjabi, I have experience leading projects and collaborating effectively with teams. If I werenâ€™t a software engineer, Iâ€™d be an experimental psychologist, driven by a curiosity to understand why people behave the way they do. My blend of technical expertise and a passion for understanding human behavior fuels my approach to creating impactful solutions.
